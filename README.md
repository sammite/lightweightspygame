So there's this super simple game I've enjoyed playing with people. 

My understanding is that it's a simplified version of the game "spyfall"

1. A location is randomly picked from a list (which everyone playing should have).

2. Every player except one gets informed of the location.

3. The last player is the "spy."

4. People take turns asking each other yes or no questions about the location.

5. At any point, the spy can interrupt and guess the location to win. (Obviously the spy loses if they guess wrong.)

6. Alternatively, if it's your turn, you can accuse the spy. If you get it right, the spy loses.


That's it, thats the whole game. There are various branded and non-branded versions of this on various apps, and I've always found it a bit infuriating that
mostly they don't actually improve the game, they just charge you 5 bucks to add a couple of locations to the list.

So I vibe coded up a quick python script that does the same thing. Just get one person in front of the screen at a time. Share the list of locations ahead of time.


That's it, that's the whole thing.
